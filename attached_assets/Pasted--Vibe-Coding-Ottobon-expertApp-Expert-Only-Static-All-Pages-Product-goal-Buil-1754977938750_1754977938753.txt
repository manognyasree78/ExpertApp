Welcome to expertApp Expert Network
As an expert on the expertApp platform, you'll be part of an innovative AI-powered consulting ecosystem. These guidelines ensure quality service delivery and optimal user experience.

**Knowledge Contribution: Powering expertApp AI Agents**
Your invaluable expertise is the foundation of our AI agents. To ensure our AI can effectively learn and deliver high-quality insights to users, we require your knowledge to be provided in a structured and comprehensive manner.

1. **Purpose of Knowledge Contribution:**
   The knowledge you provide will be used to train our domain-specific AI agents, enabling them to answer a wide range of user queries confidently.
2. **Recommended Knowledge Formats & Structure:**
   To optimize AI learning and retrieval, please structure your knowledge as follows. We encourage clear, concise, and factual content.

A. **Structured Q\&A Pairs (Primary Method):**
Provide common questions within your domain and their definitive, expert answers. Think of questions users would typically ask and provide thorough, yet succinct, responses.
**Example**
Q: "What are the key differences between Series A and Series B funding?"
A: "Series A focuses on product development and market validation with seed funding, while Series B is for scaling a proven business model, often with higher valuations and larger investments."

B. **Topic-Specific Articles/Whitepapers:**
Submit concise articles or mini-whitepapers on core topics within your sub-domains. These should cover fundamental concepts, best practices, and common challenges.
Each article should be well-organized with headings, subheadings, and bullet points for readability.

C. **Case Studies (with Solutions):**
Present real or hypothetical case studies relevant to your expertise, outlining the problem, your expert analysis, and the recommended solution/strategy.
Ensure all proprietary or sensitive client information is anonymized or removed.

D. **Glossaries/Definitions:**
Provide key industry terms and their precise definitions. This helps the AI understand domain-specific language.

3. **Content Quality & Guidelines:**
   • Accuracy: All information must be factually correct and up-to-date within your domain.
   • Clarity & Conciseness: Write clearly and avoid jargon where simpler terms suffice. Aim for direct answers.

   • Originality: All submitted knowledge must be your original work or properly cited where external sources are referenced (for context, not for direct AI training).
4. **How to Submit Your Knowledge:**
   • Upon successful completion of your vetting, you will be granted access to our Expert Knowledge Portal (or a designated content management system).
   • This portal will provide structured templates for Q\&A pairs, article submissions, and case studies, guiding you through the input process.
   • Accepted File Formats (for initial drafts/bulk upload if applicable): For initial bulk submissions, we accept documents in .docx, .txt, and structured .csv or .json for Q\&A pairs.
   • Review Process: Your submitted knowledge will undergo a review process by our content team to ensure it meets our quality and formatting standards for AI ingestion.

## Interactions & persistence

* Client-side routing only; no reloads
* All buttons show gentle **toasts** (success/info) where appropriate

  * `auth` after Login/Signup (so name shows in portal header)

  * `approval.approved` after Submit
* **Avatar menu** actions:

  * Profile Settings → `/portal/profile`

---

## Acceptance checklist (QA)

1. Landing uses dark theme; **navbar appears only on \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*`/`**.
2. All expert CTAs read **Join Now**; they open the Auth modal.
3. Auth modal validates, traps focus, locks scroll; submit → `/join` and stores name/email.
4. Onboarding form matches all fields; **Guidelines modal is scrollable** and must be acknowledged; **Submit** stays disabled until required fields + guidelines + terms are done.
5. Submit sets approval and routes to `/portal/dashboard`.
6. Portal header shows **Hi, {name}** and an **avatar**; avatar menu has **Profile Settings** and **Logout** (logout returns to landing and clears state).
7. Sidebar pages: **Dashboard, Contribute Knowledge, My Knowledge Status, Earnings, Support** all open and show the specified content.
8. **Profile Settings page** opens only from avatar menu and matches the screenshots (tabs, fields, badges, stats).
9. All interactive elements have visible focus; everything is keyboard accessible.
